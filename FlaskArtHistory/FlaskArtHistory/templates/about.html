                Paris, the former Lutetiahas been evangelized from the 3rd century. There were around 250 enough Christians to get Pope Fabien send there as Bishop first, Dyonisius, our Saint Denis became patron saint of Paris. Christians being persecuted so in Gaul as in all the Christian Empire, the Bishop Denis had to worship secretly without doubt in a single room of a Gallo-Roman villa. Denis also was martyred a few years later with his assistants on the Mount mercurycalled since Mount Martyrum (Montmartre). His successors lived in hiding until the peace of the Church by Emperor Constantine in 313.

                It then became possible to build a first Christian buildingprobably on the left bank, and perhaps, according to some stories, on the side of the current Val-de-Grace. In fact, we know nothing definite on this first cathedral or the following. Excavations were conducted at different periods in the eastern part of the island of the city, there where now stands the Cathedral Notre Dame. They think that there is in its location at the beginning of our era a pagan templereplaced later by a large Christian basilica with five navesprobably quite similar to the ancient basilicas of Rome and Ravenna. But we do not know if this Cathedral,. dedicated to saint Stephenhad been raised in the fourth century and would have been revised subsequently or if it is believed to date from the seventh century with older items in reinvestment. A certainty, however: This St. Stephen Cathedral was very large. Its fa?ade Western, located 40 metres further West than the current fa?ade of Notre Dame, had a width barely lower, as the total length of the building, it represented a little more than half of the current. Inside, the ships were separated by columns of marble and the walls were covered with mosaics. According to the liturgical use, it was completed on its North by side a baptistery, known as St. John the round.

                St. Stephen's Cathedral seems to have been regularly maintained and repaired, enough in any case to resist the wars and the ravages of time. However, in the middle of the 12th century under the reign of Louis VII,. the Bishop Maurice de Sully and the chapter have taken an extremely important decision: build a new Cathedral in place of St. Stephenmuch longer and higher that the former, as permitted new architectural techniques that began to be used, the style ogival, commonly called Gothic nowadays.

                One of the most notable monuments in Paris (and in all of Europe for that matter) is the Notre Dame Cathedral. This Catholic treasure is over 800 years old. It is located on a small island called the Ile de la Cite in the middle of river Seine. The building of the cathedral was completed over the course of 200 years; it was started in 1163 during the reign of King Louis VII and was completed in 1345.

                As is the case with most notable historical monuments, The Notre dame Cathedral Paris has its own share of both the glorious and the tragic historical moments that will forever remain indelible in the mind of people everywhere. Among them is the crowning of Henry VI of England right inside the cathedral in 1431. The Cathedral was at one time in a stage of total disrepair and close to the point of being demolished, but was later saved by Napoleon who himself was crowned Emperor in 1804 inside the Cathedral.

                <br />
                After restoring the Cathedral back to its formal beauty and in the midst of World War II, it was rumoured that the German soldiers might destroy the newly installed stained glass. It was therefore removed and only reinstalled again after the war had ended. The steps were taken because of only one particular archeological glass window called the Rose window which is supposed to be the biggest glass window in the world produced in the 13th century.

                Discussing the history of the Notre Dame Cathedral Paris would not be complete without discussing the most famous story of the peasant girl, Joan of Arc, who is well documented in the history books of France. She was very brave and claimed that she had visions from God. This poor girl had spiritual and character richness even though she had no material goods. Through her visions and courage, she helped France in the battles against the English troops. While using the wise military tactics of Joan of Arc, the well known heroine, France won many fights against England. She also was a great supporter of the monarchy; she is indirectly the reason why Charles VII was crowned. However, Joan of Arc was captured by the Burundians', accused of heresy and tragically, she was burned at the stake. But this was not the end of the brave girl. On the 7 July 1456, Joan of Arc was declared innocent and a martyr. In 1909 she was beatified in the famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris by Pope Pius X.

                Notre Dame Cathedral which can also be called "our lady" is still in use today by the Roman Catholic Church for Sunday mass and it is the seat of the Archbishop of Paris. A notable and distinct historical artefact which is very 
                popular today is the famous bell that has been redesigned to ring automatically. Any visitor to the bell tower should be prepared to climb the 140 steps staircase, if desirous of seeing the historical bell or have a glimpse of the city of Paris.

                <br />
                Also inside the Notre Dame Cathedral, among so many historical artefacts, is the notable 17th century organ with all of its parts still functional. There are also drawings, plans and engravings which showed the old and hidden mysteries of several of the church developments and how the city of Paris came into being.
